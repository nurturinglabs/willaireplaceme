  "summary": "Quality assurance and testing engineering face among the highest automation rates in the tech industry, as AI can now generate comprehensive test suites, execute regression tests, and identify visual bugs with superhuman speed and consistency. The systematic, pattern-based nature of most testing work makes it an ideal target for AI automation, with tools capable of analyzing code changes and automatically generating relevant test cases. The human role is evolving toward test strategy, edge case identification in novel domains, and the critical thinking needed to define what quality means for complex systems.",
