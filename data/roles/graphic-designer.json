  "summary": "Graphic design is experiencing a democratization revolution as AI image generation tools enable anyone to create professional-quality visuals from text descriptions. The production layer of design, including stock imagery creation, social media graphics, and basic layouts, has been dramatically automated by tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Canva AI. However, the strategic and conceptual dimensions of design, including brand identity systems, design thinking, and the ability to translate complex ideas into visual narratives, remain deeply human skills that AI cannot authentically replicate.",
