  "summary": "Software engineering is undergoing a profound transformation as AI coding assistants become capable of generating, reviewing, and debugging code at scale. While foundational tasks like boilerplate generation and unit testing are heavily automated, the human role is shifting toward system design, product thinking, and cross-functional leadership. Engineers who embrace AI as a force multiplier rather than a threat will find their productivity soaring, but those who rely solely on implementation skills face significant displacement.",
